# Running a facilitation for a team.

Do all of these things *now* to facilitate the entire process.

## General
- General facilitation:
    - Establish clear goal of meeting at start of meeting to gain Alignment.
        - Make sure you agree on purpose before getting underway
    - Identical posit colors makes more animosity

## One week before THA
- [ ] Collect or have someone else collect colored Post-Its
- [ ] Collect or have someone else collect pens

## Two days before THA
- [ ] Have the entire team read the [THA Getting Started Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h34W05UgqHF935SNWxZK8hoSBYK-w3-wBwSPPr1FpD8/edit). 
  - This helps lay the groundwork for the exercise and gives folks a chance to ask questions and align as a team before moving forward.
- [ ] Create a [spreadsheet or RealtimeBoard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YI7hGKT-MEA43pecXZK4mdfYHpUV3dmriad7H3plcZE/edit#heading=h.gleuwr3p64nm) to capture votes and notes.
    - [ ] Link to spreadsheet
    - [ ] Link to Miro board
  - The goal of these tools is to allow an easy way to capture data, vote, and have an artifact to look back on.
  - [ ] (Optionally) Set up a remote video conference for the meeting if needed.

## Prior to THA
- [ ] Create Github Issue using the [Pre-Meeting checklist](PRE_MEETING.md)
- [ ] Create Github Issue using the [THA checklist](MEETING.md)
- [ ] Schedule Pre-Meeting for two days before the THA with PM & Anchor.
- [ ] Schedule THA with entire team.

## After THA
- [ ] Create reminder to send [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIcb7_zfPcEST77IDlpmwuBN9WVwanyKSTDyuCDDtPgVyrXQ/viewform) two days after event.

## Notes
- Even if the THA is all green, it reinforces positive activities.
- Avoid solutionizing during initial meeting, it takes away from the THA.
