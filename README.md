This repository is an attempt to gather thoughts on a THA practice.

It includes what a relatively complete sequence of events for running a THA.

## General facilitation
- To gain alignment, establish clear purpose before getting underway.

# Running a THA

## After you agree to running a THA
- [ ] Schedule Pre-Meeting approximately two days before the THA.
    - Team reps and co-facilitators
- [ ] Schedule THA.
    - Whole team
- [ ] Make sure to include remote video conference link if meetings are remote.
- [ ] Create or use previous [spreadsheet / RealtimeBoard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YI7hGKT-MEA43pecXZK4mdfYHpUV3dmriad7H3plcZE/edit#heading=h.gleuwr3p64nm) to capture votes and notes.
- [ ] When possible review previous THA notes.
- [ ] Learn team member names.

## For locally facilitate THAs (It's good to do this a week or so in advance.)
- [ ] Facilitator or co-facilitator collect colored Post-Its
- [ ] Facilitator or co-facilitator collect pens

## After THA
- [ ] Send the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIcb7_zfPcEST77IDlpmwuBN9WVwanyKSTDyuCDDtPgVyrXQ/viewform).
  - (TODO: Get some details on how this is managed.)

## Notes
- Even if the THA is all green, it reinforces positive activities.
- Avoid solutionizing during initial meeting, a THA is about exploration.
