### For locally-facilitated THAs (It's good to do this a week or so in advance.)

- [ ] Facilitator or co-facilitator collect colored Post-Its
- [ ] Facilitator or co-facilitator collect pens

### After THA

- [ ] Send the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIcb7_zfPcEST77IDlpmwuBN9WVwanyKSTDyuCDDtPgVyrXQ/viewform).
  - (TODO: Get some details on how this is managed.)
- [ ] Send a follow-up email or message

### Notes

- Even if the THA is all green, it reinforces positive activities.
- Avoid solutionizing during initial meeting, a THA is about exploration.
