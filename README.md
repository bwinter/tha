# About

I (Brendan Winter) created this repository as an attempt to gather my thoughts on my THA
practice.

It includes what I believe is a relatively complete sequence of events for
running a THA. It has gone through a number of iterations and I have used it less and less over time, as
I have become more practiced.

I would love it if other facilitators contributed to the repository by creating Issues or Pull Requests.

## General facilitation
- Establish clear goal.
  - This gains Alignment.
- Agree on a purpose before getting underway.

# Running a THA

An effective technique I have seen teams' use to handle complex manual processes are check lists
that get copied into Github Issues, I am leveraging this process here. The
primary benefit is ensuring you remember all the minutia of this process amongst all your other
work. One thing to be wary of is letting yourself use these as a script rather than a reference.

Note: as time has gone on and I have become more confident, I have migrated away from the Github Issue technique and instead
use the MD files as references directly -- leaning less on check off list itemes.

## Once you learn about the THA
- [ ] Create Github Issue using the [Pre-Meeting checklist](PRE_MEETING.md)
- [ ] Create Github Issue using the [THA-Meeting checklist](THA_MEETING.md)
- [ ] Schedule THA with entire team.
- [ ] Schedule Pre-Meeting approximately two days before the THA with the teams' representatives (usually anchor or PM).

## For locally facilitate THAs (It's good to do this a week or so in advance.)
- [ ] Facilitator or co-facilitator collect colored Post-Its
- [ ] Facilitator or co-facilitator collect pens

## Two days before THA
- [ ] Have the entire team read the [THA Getting Started Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h34W05UgqHF935SNWxZK8hoSBYK-w3-wBwSPPr1FpD8/edit). 
  - This helps lay the groundwork for the exercise and gives folks a chance to ask questions and align as a team before moving forward.
- [ ] Create a [spreadsheet or RealtimeBoard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YI7hGKT-MEA43pecXZK4mdfYHpUV3dmriad7H3plcZE/edit#heading=h.gleuwr3p64nm) to capture votes and notes.
    - [ ] Link to spreadsheet
    - [ ] Link to Miro board
  - The goal of these tools is to allow an easy way to capture data, vote, and have an artifact to look back on.
  - [ ] (Optionally) Set up a remote video conference for the meeting if needed.


## After THA
- [ ] Send the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIcb7_zfPcEST77IDlpmwuBN9WVwanyKSTDyuCDDtPgVyrXQ/viewform).
  - (TODO: Get some details on how this is managed.)

## Notes
- Even if the THA is all green, it reinforces positive activities.
- Avoid solutionizing during initial meeting, it takes away from the THA.
