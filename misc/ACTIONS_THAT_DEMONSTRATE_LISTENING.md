# Actions that demonstrate listening in a conversation
### Adaptend from Conscious Business Coaching by Fred Kofman

Goal: Practice understanding while releasing polarizing thinking about the rightness or wrongness of others' ideas or opinions.
- Goal is a destination, on a journey.

- Goal is an imperative with authority.
    - And authority that enforces the goal.
    - If the goal is not immediately achieved, you have failed.
    - Brings impractical restraints into existence. 

Goal: What do I want to bring to a coversation as a listener?
What do I care about?
- Options: 
    - Determining what is right/wrong? 
    - Understanding where someone else is coming from?
    - Mutual understanding and a sense of connection?
    - Building trust and relationship?
    - Is it possible to hold my disagreement and make the other person feel understood/loved at the same time?


- *Focus.* Look at the person speaking and/or the other participants. Don't do anything else.
- *Be quiet.* Let the person speaking completely finish before you talk. Allow at least 5 seconds to elapse between the moment they stop talking and the moment you start talking. This is the minimum amount of time needed to absorb all of what they said, including their last word, to allow them space to take a breath and continue in case they are not finished talking, and to think about what's been said and how you want to respond.
- *Encourage* the person speaking to keep talking. Nod. Paraphrase. "I think I heard you say... Did I get that right?"
- *Summarize.* Play back what you heard as the essential point. "It sounds like what's most important to you is...?"
- *Check.* Ask if you got the point and let the person speaking correct you if you didn't get it. "Is it that or something else?"
- *Validate* and acknowledge the legitimacy of the speaker's point. "I can see why that's so important." You don't have to agree to validate their truth.
- *Inquire.* Ask what the speaker would like from you (if anything).
- *End of Activity - Reflection Questions*: 
    - How did you do? 
    - Notice what parts of this practice feel easy or challenging for you.
    - What do you notice is happening in your body when you try this? 
    - What is your internal self-talk that supports this practice or hinders it? 
    - Are their certain internal power dynamics that make this practice possible or threatening? 
    - What impact to you notice on the conversation?
