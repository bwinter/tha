Search for “every day tools” facilitation workshop at pivotal

I think there might be a framework where we have a set of GREEN.md and RED.md docs that give suggestions for different colored teams. (Suggestions have a tendency to change quite a bit depending on this.)


- Probing questions:
    - “What is the feeling?”
    - “Do you feel like you have the freedom to do X?”
    - “Do you feel like you might suffer negative recourse by saying something?” 
    - Get examples, specifics
    - “Do you feel like you have space to suggest change?”
    - Build comfort for being more specific.
    
- Interesting idea:
    - Have people put their ideas on post-its
    - Ask: “what things do we notice about these” “any patterns” (don’t do reflective listening)
