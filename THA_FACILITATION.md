  - This helps lay the groundwork for the exercise and gives folks a chance to ask questions and align as a team before moving forward.
- [ ] Create a [spreadsheet or RealtimeBoard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YI7hGKT-MEA43pecXZK4mdfYHpUV3dmriad7H3plcZE/edit#heading=h.gleuwr3p64nm) to capture votes and notes.
