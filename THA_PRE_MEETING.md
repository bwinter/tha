  - [ ] Are there any cultural differences we should be aware of?
- [ ] Ask the team representatives if there is anything difficult that the team has been going through lately that would be helpful to know before entering the THA discussion. Example questions include:
  - [ ] What is your understanding of psychological safety on the team currently?
  - [ ] Are there difficult dynamics between team members that you should look out for?
  - [ ] Are there any particularly talkative or quiet folks?
  - [ ] Do they want to have the leadership representative participate, shadow, or skip the exercise?
- [ ] Review the [recommended metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d98EX4P0dyl99Pd9jJN6nZ4QvBm0GIKhD2RZkgnF03w/edit) with the team representatives and work with them to customize them if need be.
