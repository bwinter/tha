# Short blurlb for calendar invite.
This meeting is to ensure the team representatives understand the exercise and its value, and that the facilitator understands the existing team dynamics.

As a primer for the prior: the goal of a THA is to have a quality, pointed discussion with your entire team about systemic topics related to team health. It is not populate the THA scorecard or gloss over issues.

# Meeting agenda

- What were prior outcomes?
    - Action items
    - Colors for various metrics (it’s not important to compare, but it can be useful to learn more about the team.)
    - Possibly more important is to check the notes.
    - It might be valuable to have an “inside person”, someone who can throw a red to help make it okay to do so. One challenge of these meetings is poor psych safety can lead to green-washing.

- [ ] Are there are any changes from the last THA you would like to see?

- [ ] Do you want a leadership representative to participate, shadow, or skip the exercise?
    - LL as default

- [ ] Know composition of team / who has been in a previous THA, how long have they been on the team? Basically pre, intro. Names are probably not even important here.
- [ ] Are there any particularly talkative or quiet folks?

- [ ] What is your understanding of psychological safety on the team currently?

- [ ] Is there anything you are worried about?

- [ ] Is there anything you hope will come up?

- [ ] Ask the team representatives to forward the [THA Getting Started document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h34W05UgqHF935SNWxZK8hoSBYK-w3-wBwSPPr1FpD8/edit) to their team to read before the THA.

- [ ] Review the [recommended metrics]( ) with the team representatives and work with them to customize them if need be.
