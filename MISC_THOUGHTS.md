# About

This file contains some thoughts I have run into along my THA facilitation journey.

It's possible some of this would be better in a Github Issue -- Slack is a good
way to have a conversation but threads of thought become undescoverable pretty
quickly. Maybe outcomes need to get moved into here ü§î -- maybe some things just get
their 15 min of fame before fading.

- Interesting idea:
    - Have people put their ideas on post-its
    - Ask: ‚Äúwhat things do we notice about these‚Äù ‚Äúany patterns‚Äù (don‚Äôt do reflective listening)

- Use your curiosity to drive Reflective Listening (aka ask questions).
- Probing questions:
    - ‚ÄúWhat is the feeling?‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúDo you feel like you have the freedom to do X?‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúDo you feel like you might suffer negative recourse by saying something?‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúDo you feel like you have space to suggest change?‚Äù
    - Get examples, specifics
    - Build comfort for being more specific.

Search for ‚Äúevery day tools‚Äù facilitation workshop at pivotal (TODO: I no longer understand this reference.)

I think there might be a framework where we have a set of GREEN.md and RED.md docs that give suggestions for different colored teams. (Suggestions have a tendency to change quite a bit depending on this.)

#### Books I need to look into
- Amy Edmondson
- Non-violent communication
- Sir Francis Bacon
- Radical Candor - I think this is a book

#### Power Point / Miro
- Some way to help make the way we do the voting more obvious.
- Make something like a power point presentation so people can see what I am
  reading.

#### Psych Safety

- I have heard the THA described as a psychological safety tune-up.

- Find ways to build comfort up front, likely through vulnerability.
    - If there is an LL have them admit some mistake.
    - Possibly the same for other team member in position of power - e.g. anchor or pm

- Breaking ice:
    - Ice breaker game - e.g. ‚ÄúHalf animal‚Äù on a pos-it note that someone else finishes.
    - Something not interesting about self. (I wish I had saved this article.) Generically, something not interesting is easier to come up with, is less competative and still gets conversation going.

Remember all the positive experiences the team spoke about.

Even if you uncovered negative feelings, notice the team was strong enough to discuss them.

#### Two Taco Problem
I learned about this concept a from Fred Krone who learned it from a
facilitation training. (I have done some research that appears to have led back
to the creator (Link TODO)).

In short, two or more humans are prone to *think* they are talking about the *"same"* thing when in fact, they are not.
In actuality, talking about the same concept is essentially impossible. Our perceptions of reality are subtly different
given the diverse contexts we bring to the table. This can also lead to
missunderstandings and communication breakdown when people who believe they are
talking about the same thing disagree on something they hold differently in
their minds.

The "two taco" description is overly simplified to the point where you
need to understand the concept before it becomes a useful memonic. Essentially,
if two people think they are talking about the same type of taco they might not
be and it is possible this could lead to a missunderstanding -- which of course
is often a source of conflict. (Hard to imagine how tacos would lead to conflict
but this is a memonic not an actual example.)

An example I have seen was when two individuals attempted to run an SRE style D&D based
on an actual incident. However they never fully coordinated on the bug they wanted to discuss.
It just so happened two very similar bugs had happened around a similar
time frame. And it also just so happened that they each picked a different bug.
However, no one in the D&D realized this, not the participants or the
facilitators until a few hours of the facilitators ping-pong-ing the
facilitation leadership role. Needless to say, participants were quite confused
when facilitators gave examples that were leading them in two different
directions.

One interesting technique (I forgot to save a link üò≠) I learned that can potentially shed light
on this effect is describe as "Drawing the process of creating Toast." In this activity, you ask participants
to individually draw the process of creating toast (art quality is not
important). After they are done, when drawings are compared, it is always clear
there is a huge difference between how people see this process. Some have a
detailed view, some have very high level views; some focus more on different
aspects of the process. The variants are very large. Thus showing how, even
something simple can be seen very differently from different perspectives.
