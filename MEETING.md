Create a github issue with this as the content and a title including the team's name.

- [ ] Put Streatchly on break
- [ ] Silence phone

- Reactive Listening
    - Use your curiosity (if time permits...)
- “Parking Lot” for items that “loop”

## Meeting
- [ ] Introduction
    - Name, please correct my pronunciation.
    - Role,
    - Goals of meeting (what do you think they are / what do you know?)
    - Optionally pronouns. 
  - [ ] Introduce yourself (name, job, team, give pronouns)
    - Make a list of names. (for coordinating round-robin)
    - Name on Zoom
    
  - [ ] Give a quick explanation of the exercise format as a refresher
    - THA is very much like a retrospective
    - THA is a quarterly meeting
    - THA is a Longer meeting
    - The goal of a THA is to have a quality discussion (not populate a scorecard).
    - This is a discussion / dialogue not a test. We aren’t here to generate a green score card. We are here to identify what we discover to be pain points - with the long term goal of the team overcoming them.
    - “THA can be though of as a phyc safety tune-up.”
    - Round-robin; so, that everyone has space for their voice.
    - Silent voting, taking notes, w/ vote.
        - followed by tally.
    - It is okay for everyone to interpret metrics differently.
    - We are taking notes but they aren't used externally w/o permission.
    - Tiny retro at end
    - TODO: Explain anti-goals.
    
- [ ] Establish [Ground Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Q9uand09WHwiWZO21A9rD6S-3953CqP0v-xEj-xSCg/edit#heading=h.3f96t1973epx) and read the [Psychological Safety script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Q9uand09WHwiWZO21A9rD6S-3953CqP0v-xEj-xSCg/edit#heading=h.skek14hxa5vk)
  - Ensure everyone agrees that this is a safe space to share their feelings, and that criticism will not cause retaliation
  - Listen deep enough to be changed
  
    - Try to use the “I” perspective when possible. Don’t feel over committed, this is simply a tool to help you avoid being hurtful.
     
    - Use your active listening skills.
        - Be present.
        - Don’t bring devices.
    
    - Don’t minimize, just add on to prior team mate’s statements.
        - e.g. “yes, and” rather than “yes, but” or “no”.
    
    - 1 voice at a time:
        - Wiggly fingers or knocking for agreement.
        - Thumbs up for praise.
    
    - Parking lot. 
        - We will make sure there is an owner who will make sure the item gets stored somewhere.
   
- [ ] Questions about what has been said so far?
- [ ] Deep breath
- [ ] Explain Voting Round (Read below checklist once.)
- [ ] Voting Round
  - There are multiple metrics we will be discussing.
  - I will read them and their *positive* and *negative* statements. 
  - We will take a moment to ensure everyone understands the meaning of the statements.
    - These questions are intentionally wishy-washy, try to “lean into them”.
    - Don’t just green-wash.
    - We are looking to suss out pain points that may have gone unnoticed.
  - We will give ~45 seconds to reflect on how each metric and accompanying statements make you feel.
    - At the end of the 45 we will count down to 10, if you aren’t done yet stop us.
    - To help reduce bias, consider creating some notes.
        - It can help remind you the way you voted.
        - Notes can get confusing so I also recommend including an acronym that references the metric (we may reorder so row # could change).
  - We will repeat this same process for the rest of the metrics
  - We will then take a deep breath to help stay relaxed and then take a short break.
  - We will record the votes on the worksheet.
- [ ] Deep breath
- [ ] Have team go on a 10-minute break.
- [ ] Sequence the Metrics
    - Compliment sandwich
        - Start with a green metric first to get physic safety up.
- [ ] Explain Discussion Round (Below check list?)
- [ ] Discussion Round
  - TODO: explain how to use vote first technique
  - I will read each metric / statements aloud again.
  - Go around the table, giving every person the opportunity to speak individually about how they felt on that particular topic.
  - During the discussion round, try not to say “pass”. In stead restate what you agree with. You may say it a different way that provides new insight. Or uncover a misunderstanding about the topic as it gives others a chance to say “that’s not quite what I meant”.
  
  - Once each person has spoken, give a final space for any other discussions on the topic. 
    - Ensure there is not a disproportionate amount of time given to any one person (unless of course it’s warranted). 
  - (optional) Get a read on whether the team feels like this is getting better (trending up) or getting worse (trending down). Record on scorecard.
  - Repeat with all of the other metrics
    - Choosing the next person in line to begin discussions.
  - Take 10 or 15 minute breaks periodically for refreshments and restrooms.
- [ ] Any other Questions? (e.g. how is the artifact used?)
- [ ] (If time permits) Show the [Optional metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d98EX4P0dyl99Pd9jJN6nZ4QvBm0GIKhD2RZkgnF03w/edit#gid=1805229700)
- [ ] Mini retro (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for)
- [ ] Congratulate everyone and thank them for their input.
