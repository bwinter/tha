# Follow-up email

```
- Thank you / back pat for participation

Feedback for James and I, liked, learnded, longed for, lacked.

Alternatively, if you were someone who saw a metric that was confusing, I would love a deeper explination of the confusion I could share back with the THA facilitators.

Feedback wanted for the confusing metrics:

- We know what is needed and have the right team to do it. Nobody is overworked and everything important is being done.
- We don’t know what our roles and responsibilities are. We don’t know who’s accountable for the things that need to get done.

- Our community members contribute to our codebase
- The community is unable to contribute to the code base (Is unable to make even minor fixes)

- Our community members know what we are doing and have a say in our product vision
- It is hard for the community to find information about our future plans for the product.

- Every aspect of every role is being utilized in the team
- We have crucial roles missing / not filled

This email will only go to James and I so if there is anything else that would have helped you feel more comfortable and you are willing to share, please do so.
