# Checklist to be used by facilitator for THA
Create a github issue with this as the content and a title including the team's name.

- [ ] Introduction
  - [ ] Ask folks to write name tags or update their names in the remote conference so you can tell who is who.
  - [ ] Ask folks to introduce themselves, including their role on the team
  - [ ] Give a quick explanation of the exercise format as a refresher
  - [ ] Specifically, mention that everyone will interpret the metrics differently and they should interpret them from their own perspective.
- [ ] Establish Ground Rules and read the Psychological Safety script
  - [ ] Review the ground rules on the template
  - [ ] Ensure everyone agrees that this is a safe space to share their feelings, and that criticism will not cause retaliation
- [ ] Voting Round
  - [ ] Read aloud the name of the metric
  - [ ] Read aloud the Happy and Crappy statements
  - [ ] Ensure everyone understands the meaning of the statements
  - [ ] Vote! 
  - [ ] Have each member record how they voted (it’s easy to forget!), e.g. writing the metric name on green/yellow/red post-its
  - [ ] Record the team votes on the scorecard
  - [ ] Repeat for the rest of the metrics
- [ ] Sequence the Metrics
- [ ] Have the team go on a 10-minute break.
- [ ] Use this time to sequence the metrics for the discussion round. 
- [ ] Discussion Round
  - [ ] Go around the table, giving every person the opportunity to speak individually. t how they felt on that particular topic. If someone doesn’t have anything else to add to the conversation when it’s their turn to speak, they can simply say “covered”, and move on.
  - [ ] Once each person has spoken, give a final space for any other discussions on the topic. Ensure there is not a disproportionate amount of time given to any one person (unless of course it’s warranted). 
  - [ ] Get a read on whether the team feels like this is getting better (trending up) or getting worse (trending down). Record on scorecard.
  - [ ] Repeat with all of the other metrics, choosing the next person in line to begin discussions. Take 10 or 15 minute breaks periodically for refreshments and restrooms.
- [ ] Repeat the voting and discussion for the retrospective “Team Health Assessment” metric.
- [ ] Congratulate yourselves!
