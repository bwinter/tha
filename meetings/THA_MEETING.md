# Checklist to be used by facilitator for THA
Create a github issue with this as the content and a title including the team's name.

- [ ] Put Streatchly on break
- [ ] Silence phone

- [ ] Introduction
  - [ ] Introduce yourself (name, job, team, give pronouns)
  - [ ] Have co-facilitators introduce themselves
  - [ ] Ask attendees to introduce themselves, including their role on the team.
    - Make a list of names. (for coordinating round-robin)
  - [ ] Give a quick explanation of the exercise format as a refresher
    - THA is very much like a retrospective
    - THA is a quarterly meeting
    - THA is a Longer meeting
    - The goal of a THA is to have a quality discussion (not populate a scorecard).
    - Round-robin; so, that everyone has space for their voice.
    - Silent voting, taking notes, followed by tally.
    - It is okay for everyone to interpret metrics differently.
    - Tiny retro at end
- [ ] Establish [Ground Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Q9uand09WHwiWZO21A9rD6S-3953CqP0v-xEj-xSCg/edit#heading=h.3f96t1973epx) and read the [Psychological Safety script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Q9uand09WHwiWZO21A9rD6S-3953CqP0v-xEj-xSCg/edit#heading=h.skek14hxa5vk)
  - Ensure everyone agrees that this is a safe space to share their feelings, and that criticism will not cause retaliation
- [ ] Questions about what has been said so far?
- [ ] Deep breath
- [ ] Explain Voting Round (Read below checklist once.)
- [ ] Voting Round
  - I will read aloud the name of the metric
  - I will then read aloud the Happy and Crappy statements
  - Ensure everyone understands the meaning of the statements
  - Vote on your paper! (Silently)
  - Have each member record how they voted (it’s easy to forget!), e.g. writing the metric name on green/yellow/red post-its
  - Repeat for the rest of the metrics
- [ ] Record the team votes on the scorecard
- [ ] Deep breath
- [ ] Have team go on a 10-minute break.
- [ ] Sequence the Metrics
- [ ] Explain Discussion Round (Below check list?)
- [ ] Discussion Round
  - TODO: explain to use vote first
  - I will read each metric / statements aloud again.
  - Go around the table, giving every person the opportunity to speak individually about how they felt on that particular topic.
  - If someone doesn’t have anything else to add to the conversation when it’s their turn to speak, they can simply say “covered”, and move on.
  - Once each person has spoken, give a final space for any other discussions on the topic. 
    - Ensure there is not a disproportionate amount of time given to any one person (unless of course it’s warranted). 
  - (optional) Get a read on whether the team feels like this is getting better (trending up) or getting worse (trending down). Record on scorecard.
  - Repeat with all of the other metrics
    - Choosing the next person in line to begin discussions.
  - Take 10 or 15 minute breaks periodically for refreshments and restrooms.
- [ ] Any other Questions? (e.g. how is the artifact used?)
- [ ] (If time permits) Show the [Optional metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d98EX4P0dyl99Pd9jJN6nZ4QvBm0GIKhD2RZkgnF03w/edit#gid=1805229700)
- [ ] Mini retro (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for)
- [ ] Congratulate everyone and thank them for their input.
