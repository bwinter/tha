- [ ] Put Streatchly on break (and other notifications)
- [ ] Silence phone

- Use your curiosity to drive Reactive Listening (aka ask questions).

- Techniques for managing participant names:
  - Remember, Zoom order can change.
  - Draw a virtual table and place people around it.
  - Pronouncing new names can be extremely hard, apologize in advance and push on.

- Breaking ice:
  - Something not interesting about self. (I wish I had saved this article.) Generically, something not interesting is easier to come up with, is less competative and still gets conversation going.

---- Have all reds hold up, all greens, all yellows.

## Meeting

For secondaries / shadows
- Summarize discussion
- Help keep track of time (45 seconds for voting)
- Counting votes
- Parking lot / Action Items

### Summary (TODO: Linksify)
- Setup
- Introductions
- Description
- Ground Rules
- Voting
- Discussion

### Setup
- If, not remote:
  - Ask folks to write name cards.
- If fully, remote:
  - Ask folks to update their names.
  - Ask folks to close Slack and other messaging tools. (Qualify with common exceptions.)
  - Ask folks to turn off their camera when doing other things.

### Introductions
- Facilitator introductions (name, pronouns, team, title, THA history)
- Introductions
  - Name
  - Pronouns
  - Role on team
  - What would you like to get out of the THA?

### Description
- THA is very much like a retrospective in that it gives the team an opportunity to iterate on its process.
    - It is different in that it generally runs quarterly and is usually a 2-3 hour meeting.
- The goal of a THA is to have a high quality discussion not to solve problems.
- We can identify some pain points - with the long term goal of the team overcoming them.

- We are taking notes but we will keep them anonymous and will let you share them as you choose.
  - Their primary purpose is to allow you to return to this document and understand why votes went the way they did.

- For the sake of time, if we get stuck on a topic, we will use a “Parking Lot” for items that the team can come back to after the THA.
  - (We will make sure there is an owner who will make sure the item gets stored somewhere.)

### Format is roughly
- I read a metric and, its *positive* and *negative* statements.
- Then everyone will take a little time to reflect and vote on that metric.
- We will do this for every metric.
- After we vote on everything we will do a round-robin discuss.

### Ground Rules:
- Given the opportunity for empathy building; I have heard the THA described as a psychological safety tune-up.

- Feeling comfortable raising concerns is a sign of a healthy team.

- The Team Health Assessment only works if we collectively establish this as a space with “psychological safety.
  - This means that we agree that there will be no retaliation for things discussed, and team members will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes.
- During discussion, everyone should try their best to speak using I/Me statements, and should minimize their references to other peoples' thoughts and actions.
- And finally, we all agree to the fundamental rule of retrospectives: we believe that everyone has performed to the best of their abilities with the information they had.

- Avoid minimizing team mate's statements.
  - e.g. use “yes, and” language rather than “yes, but”s or “no”s.
- 1 voice at a time:
  - Wiggly fingers or knocking for agreement.
  - Thumbs up for praise.
- Use your active listening skills.
  - Be present.
  - Don’t bring devices.
- Listen deeply enough to be changed.

- [ ] Any questions about what has been said so far?

- [ ] Take a deep breath before we dive into the voting round. (This one is for the facilitator)

- Anti-goals:
  - The goal is not to get all green. A THA is not a test. It is not about populating a score card.


### Voting:
- [ ] Explain (Read checklist.)
    - [ ] Voting Round
        - We will be using multiple metrics designed to drive useful discussions.
        - We will read the metric and its *positive* and *negative* statements.
        - We will take a moment to ensure everyone understands the meaning of the statements.
            - We will give 1 to 1.5 minute to reflect on how each metric and accompanying statements make you feel.
            - Raise your hand if you need more time or have a question.
            - These questions are intentionally wishy-washy, try to “lean into them”.
            - It is okay for everyone to interpret metrics differently.
            - To help retain novel thoughts, consider creating some notes.
            - Finally we will ask everyone to show how they voted and will record these votes on the worksheet.
                - Use colored post-its to help facilitators see your vote.

    - We will repeat this process for the rest of the metrics
    - After all metrics are done, we will take a deep breath (to help stay relaxed) and then take a short break.
    - [ ] Any questions about what has been said so far?

- [ ] Collect Metrics (run list above for every metric)
- [ ] Request metric sequencing feedback. (anything anyone finds particularly interesting?)
    - Compliment sandwich can be useful for red metrics.
    - Starting with a green metric first can help get physic safety up.
- [ ] First deep breath and then 10-minute break.

### Discussion:
- [ ] Explain
    - I will read each metric and accompanying statements aloud again.
    - We will iterate through the group members, giving every person the opportunity to speak individually about how they felt on a particular topic.
    - During the discussion round, try not to say “pass”. In stead restate what you agree with. You may say it a different way that provides new insight. Or uncover a misunderstanding about the topic as it gives others a chance to say “that’s not quite what I meant”.
    - Once each person has spoken, there will be a final opportunity for any other discussions on the topic.
        - We will ensure there is not a disproportionate amount of time given to any one person (unless of course it’s warranted).
    - (optional) Get a read on whether the team feels like this is getting better (trending up) or getting worse (trending down). Record on scorecard.
    - Repeat with all of the other metrics
        - Choosing the next person in line to begin discussions.
    - TODO: explain how to use vote first technique

- [ ] Any questions about what has been said so far?

- [ ] Discussion Round
    - Take 10 or 15 minute breaks periodically for refreshments, restrooms and deep breaths.

- [ ] Congratulate everyone and thank them for all their input. This can be a very draining meeting.


- [ ] Any other Questions? (e.g. how is the artifact used?)
- [ ] (If time permits) Show the [Optional metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d98EX4P0dyl99Pd9jJN6nZ4QvBm0GIKhD2RZkgnF03w/edit#gid=1805229700)
- [ ] Mini retro (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for)

# TODO: add some section about how to leverage the THA into growth.
