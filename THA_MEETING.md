# THA

## Secondaries (and Shadows)
- Summarize discussion
- Track Parking lot / Action Items
- Count votes
- Help keep track of time:
    - 1.5 minutes for voting and notes
    - 45 min max for set of metrics
    - 10 min breaks between metrics
        (remember sometimes when returning zoom windows stay black)

## Before Meeting Starts
- [ ] Put Streatchly on break (and other notifications)
- [ ] Silence phone
- [ ] Create a virtual table or list and place people around it or in it.
    - Useful for tracking who discusses first.

## Introductions
- Facilitator introductions (name, pronouns, team, role)
- Introductions  (name, pronouns, role)

- If, not remote:
  - Ask folks to write name cards.

- If fully, remote:
  - Update Zoom names.
  - Close or silence messaging tools. (Qualify with common exceptions.)
  - Ask folks to turn off their camera when doing other things.

## Description:
- THA is very much like a retrospective in that it gives the team an opportunity to iterate on process and build empathy.

- The goal of a THA is discussion and identification, not problem solving.

- The THA facilitator working group has identified a set of questions that asses team heath.

- Format is roughly:
    - I read a metric and, two accompanying *positive* and *negative* examples.
    - Everyone takes a minute to reflect on what was read.
        - Notes
        - Voting
    - We show votes as a group and tally.
    - We do this for every metric first.
    - After we vote on every metric we will do a round-robin discuss.

- Anti-goals:
    - Trying to get all green, a healthy team will surface issues.
    - Thinking of it as a scored test, there are no "correct" answers - opinions and feelings.

- We are taking notes but we will keep them anonymous and will let you share them as you choose.

- For the sake of time, if we get stuck on a topic, we will use a “Parking Lot” for items that the team can come back to after the THA.
  - (We will make sure there is an owner who will ensure the item gets stored somewhere.)

## Psychologicaly Safe Space:
- Don't retaliate, punish or humiliate team members for speaking up with ideas, questions or concerns.
- Remember that everyone has performed to the best of their abilities with the information they had.
- Be present and use your active listening skills.
- Minimize your references to other peoples' thoughts and actions.
- Try your best to speak using I or Me statements.
- Use “yes, and” language rather than “no” or “but”.
- 1 voice at a time: if you agree, use Wiggly fingers.

- Any questions?

## Voting:
- I will read each metric and its *positive* and *negative* statements.
- We will take a moment to ensure everyone understands.

- Everyone individually will take 1.5 minutes to reflect on each metric.
- To help retain novel thoughts, consider creating some notes. (If possible include vote.)
- Raise your hand if you need more time or have a question.
- Finally we will ask everyone to show how they voted and will record these votes on the worksheet.
    - Post-its or Roman

- [ ] Any questions?

- [ ] Collect Metrics (run list above for every metric)

## Discussion
- I will read a each metric and accompanying statements aloud again.
- We will then do a round robbin discussion for each.
- During the discussion round, try not to say “pass”. In stead, restate what you agree with.
- We will take 10ish minute breaks periodically for refreshments, restrooms and deep breaths.

- Any questions?

## Finsished
- [ ] Take a deep breath and congratulate everyone, thanking them for all their input.

- [ ] Any questions? (Can also Slack or email me.)
- [ ] There are also [Optional metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d98EX4P0dyl99Pd9jJN6nZ4QvBm0GIKhD2RZkgnF03w/edit#gid=1805229700) if you would like to take a look?

## Answers to Common questions:
- Q: How is a THA different from a retrospective?
- A: A THA generally runs quarterly and takes 2-3 hours.

- Q: What is the purpose of the THA artifact?
- A: To allow you to understand prior dynamics.

- Q: Why would you avoid passing during discussion?
- A: You may say it a different way that provides new insight. Or uncover a misunderstanding about the topic - it gives others a chance to say “that’s not quite what I meant”.

- Q: Are the questions intentionally wishy-washy?
- A: Yes, try to “lean into them”.

- Q: Is it possible for everyone to interpret metrics differently?
- A: Yes, it's preferable.

## TODO
- Check with THA group on the following:
    - Crappy statement containing "we": "I don't have the information *we* need to make important decisions."?
    - R&D Engagement statements are "we" not "I" wording.

- VAT categories to add:
    - fun category
    - code quality category

- THA Feedback questions:
    - Would you prefer all voting first or voting then discussing each?
